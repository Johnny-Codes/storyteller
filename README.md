# Storyteller

## Inspiration
This is the software for an embedded software/electronics project that will create new and interesting stories for children at bedtime. They child will be able to prompt the storyteller for custom stories.

A RaspberryPi will be able to listen to commands from the user. Run the applicable code. Return a story.

## Roadmap
- [ ] OpenAI integration
- [ ] Database of created stories. Ideally the child can take an old story and ask openai to add onto that story or continue a characters growth. 
- [ ] RaspberryPi integration
- [ ] Physical design
